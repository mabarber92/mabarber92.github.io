The *Automatic Collation for Diversifying Corpora* (*ACDC*) project, funded by a Level III Digital Humanities Advanced Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, aims to significantly improve the accuracy of handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script manuscripts. Our team will develop a collation tool to automatically create large amounts of training data from existing digital texts and manuscript images without time-consuming human annotation of individual manuscripts.

The *ACDC* project will accomplish this task by extending the capabilities of the text alignment tool [passim](https://github.com/dasmiq/passim) and the OCR/HTR engine [Kraken](http://kraken.re/master/index.html) to align poor initial HTR transcriptions of diverse manuscript exemplars with existing digital texts in order to automatically produce training data in a "distantly supervised" manner.

The *ACDC* tool's acceleration of the training data production process will mark an important step towards the creation of the generalizable Arabic and Persian HTR models required for the digital transcription of large-scale Persian and Arabic manuscript collections.
