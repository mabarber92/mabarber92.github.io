The [OpenITI corpus](https://github.com/OpenITI/RELEASE) is a open-access and machine-actionable collection of Persian and Arabic texts.

The large number of texts in our collection are in various stages of being transformed into standards-compliant and metadata-enriched scholarly corpus texts. They are built upon existing print editions of texts, which in most cases we obtained from [Shamilah](https://shamela.ws/), *al-Jāmiʿ al-Kabīr*, [Maktabat al-Shiʿa](http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/), [Ganjoor](https://ganjoor.net/), and other online collections that have varying levels of fidelity to the original print versions (due to manual or automatic---i.e., OCR---transcription errors).

OpenITI corpus texts are intended to be used for the purposes of computational textual analysis and search---not as digital scholarly editions of these works. They are more than accurate enough for the former (see [this article](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqt039) for further explanation).
