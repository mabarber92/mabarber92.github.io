In 2017, OpenITI joined forces with the [SHARIAsource](https://pil.law.harvard.edu/shariasource-portal/) project of the Program in Islamic Law at Harvard Law School to develop a robust and user-friendly OCR pipeline called [CorpusBuilder](https://github.com/berkmancenter/corpusbuilder). This project was funded by the Program in Islamic Law at Harvard Law School.

Version 1.0 of CorpusBuilder was released in March 2019.

Initially, an enhanced version of CorpusBuilder was slated to be developed during Phase I of the *OpenITI AOCP*.

However, in May 2020 the *OpenITI AOCP* and *SHARIAsource* teams decided to collaborate with the [eScripta project](https://escripta.hypotheses.org/) of Universit√© Paris Sciences et Lettres on the development of [eScriptorium](https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium/) instead.
