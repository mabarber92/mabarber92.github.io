Funded through two grants from [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), Phase One of the *Open Islamicate Texts Initiative Arabic-script OCR Catalyst Project* (*OpenITI AOCP*) is the first undertaking of its kind to tackle the technical and organizational barriers that historically have stymied the development of Arabic-script OCR and digital text production for Islamicate Studies.

*OpenITI AOCP* is led by an interdisciplinary team of humanities, computer science, and digital humanities co-principal investigators from [Roshan Institute for Persian Studies](https://sllc.umd.edu/fields/persian) at the University of Maryland, College Park, Northeastern University's [NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/), the Aga Khan University's [Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilisations](https://www.aku.edu/ismc/Pages/home.aspx) in London, and the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](https://mith.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, College Park. We are proud to partner with the [SHARIAsource project](https://pil.law.harvard.edu/shariasource-portal/) of the Program in Islamic Law at Harvard Law School and the [eScripta project](https://escripta.hypotheses.org/) of Université Paris Sciences et Lettres for the technical development portion of the project.

The primary technical goal of the first phase of *OpenITI AOCP* is to achieve ≥97% character accuracy rates (CARs) for OCR on the most used Persian and Arabic print typefaces. We are well on our way to achieving this goal, and we have begun preliminary testing and training data production for Ottoman Turkish and Urdu typefaces as well. Our latest OCR CAR test results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d8bSqKMjUqUYCNuwOEEqerXKmIRp7j9Id449BJkXfqg/edit?usp=sharing).

The second major deliverable of *OpenITI AOCP* is an open-source and user-friendly digital text production pipeline for Persian and Arabic texts. After initially partnering with *SHARIAsource* to develop our own pipeline, [CorpusBuilder](https://github.com/berkmancenter/corpusbuilder), we decided to join the *eScripta* team in expanding [eScriptorium](https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium/).

OpenITI's beta testing instance of eScriptorium can be found [here](https://escriptorium.openiti.org/). Please contact [John Mullan](mailto:jmullan@umd.edu) if you are interested in being a part of our user testing groups.
