Please provide with your notice the following information, consistent with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; (b) identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed; (c) identification of the infringing material and information that will permit OpenITI to locate the material; (d) information that will permit us to contact you, including an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which you may be contacted; (e) a statement by you that, in your good faith belief, use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

## 12. Reliance on Information Posted

12.1 The information presented on or through the Platform is made available solely for general information purposes. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information.

These materials do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the OpenITI. We are not responsible or liable to you or any third party for the content or accuracy of any materials provided by any third parties.
## 13. Publication of User Contributions and Exceptional User Contributions

13.1 eScriptorium exists with the broader goal to develop a corpus of machine-readable texts, for public use and computational and statistical analysis (for example, the digital analysis of text reuse). To this end, all User Contributions will be published automatically 3 years after they have been uploaded to the site. Published Islamicate texts will be added to the OpenITI corpus, at [github.com/OpenITI](https://github.com/OpenITI).

13.2 OpenITI understands that in some specific cases a User Contribution may need to remain out of the public domain for a period longer than 3 years or indefinitely (defined as an 'Exceptional User Contribution'). In cases of Exceptional User Contributions, Users should apply for an extension at [openiti\@umd.edu](mailto:openiti@umd.edu) (with subject heading 'Exceptional User Contribution') for each Exceptional User Contribution they wish to be considered. Exceptional User Contributions will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

13.3 It is recommended that users apply to OpenITI for an extension before uploading an Exceptional User Contribution. If an Exceptional User Contribution is uploaded prior to making an application, it is the user's responsibility to flag the Exceptional User Contribution to OpenITI in a timely fashion.

13.4 OpenITI will make every effort to assess Exceptional User Contributions in a timely fashion. However, OpenITI will not be held liable for the automatic publication of Exceptional User Contributions in the event that a case is not assessed before the 3-year deadline.
