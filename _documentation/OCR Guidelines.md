The following is intended as a guide for users of the OpenITI eScriptorium. For a thorough overview of the terms governing published OCR content on OpenITI you are encouraged to read the [Terms of Use]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _documentation/Terms of Use.md %}) and the [Privacy Policy]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _documentation/Privacy Policy.md %}).
## Training Materials for Using OpenITI's eScriptorium

Please see the [Resources]({{site.baseurl}}{% link resources.md %}) for videos and instructions on using eScriptorium. For questions or problems, please contact [Mathew Barber](mailto:Mathew.Barber@aku.edu).
## Guide on Publishing Copyrighted Texts

All texts uploaded to eScriptorium will be eventually added to online repositories for public use and data analysis. OpenITI has a duty to ensure all content of uploaded texts is not subject to copyright (for more details see our [Copyright Policy]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _documentation/Copyright Questions.md %})). **In order to comply with this, all editions which are still in copyright must have their copyrighted content removed, i.e., all editorial input, such as footnotes and introductory matter. You should endeavor to remove all of this material either during your scanning process or at the post-correction stage.**
## What does OpenITI do with your uploaded texts?

The goal of eScriptorium is to build an open access corpus of machine readable texts for the use of scholars and for computational analysis. To this end, you are advised that all uploaded texts will be automatically published to a public online repository after a period of 3 years.

We accept that in some exceptional cases, a text may need to remain out of the public domain for longer than 3 years, or indefinitely. In these cases, you are encouraged to apply for an exception at the address [openiti\@umd.edu](mailto:openiti@umd.edu) before uploading your text. For more details, see the 'Exceptional User Contribution' terms in the [Terms of Use]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _documentation/Terms of Use.md %}).
